Net migration is the difference of immigrants and emigrants of a country in a period of time. A positive value represents more people entering the country than leaving it, while a negative value means more people leaving than entering it.

Data of net migration was downloaded from the UNdata website and used to established a Shiny App.

This App shows countries with the highest and lowest net migration for a given year in the peroid from 1962 to 2012. 

It also shows year-by-year net migration value of any country during this peroid.
